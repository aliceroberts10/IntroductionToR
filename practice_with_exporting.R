# Practice With Importing & Exporting

# If you haven't already downloaded the bigGrades.csv file, do so. Import it into R.

# Identify the different CourseFields that can appear
# Hint - use either levels() if it's a factor, or table() if it's character or factor

# For each course type, make a new data.frame of only that type
# Example - for Math make a "math.grades" data.frame

# Each of the departments would like to get their grades in a text file, but they have different standards!
# For the Math department, create a standard CSV file with a comma seperator, no row names.
# For the Biology department, use a space as the seperator, no row names.
# For the Physics department, use a comma seperator and include row names.
# For the Chemistry department, use a space as the seperator and include row names.

# At the end you should have 4 additional CSV files. Manually open them up to verify that your code ran correctly.


# Make sure you save all your code in this R script and that the final result runs without error.
