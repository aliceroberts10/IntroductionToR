# Practice with Lists

# Create a list called 'classroom.info' containing the following things:
#   An item called 'room_number' that lists the room number of this classroom (10908)
#   An item called 'building' that lists the building this classroom is in (ASB)
#   A list called 'contents' that contains (as separate items) the following:
#       - "projector"
#       - "tables"
#       - "chairs"

# Using this list, answer the following questions:
#   What building is this classroom in?
#   What room_number is this classroom?
#   What is the first item in the contents list?
#   Add 'computer' as a fourth item in the contents list
