# Practice with Matrices

# Create a matrix that looks like this:
#               Calories    Weight    Price
# Chocolate        240        30       1.25
# Bubblegum        10         2        0.50
#     Apple        70         200      0.69

# Make sure to also set the row and column names

# Retrieve the following values from the matrix using the subsetting operators '[]'
# The price of an apple
# The calories in bubblegum
# The weight of all the foods
# The calories and weight of all the foods
# The number of calories per unit weight (divide the Calories column by the Weight column)
